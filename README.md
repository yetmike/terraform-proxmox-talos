# terraform-proxmox-talos

Terraform module to provision Talos Linux Kubernetes clusters with Proxmox

## Example usage

```bash
export PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME="root@pam"
export PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD="super-secret"
```

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    proxmox = {
      source = "bpg/proxmox"
      version = "~> 0.75.0"
    }
    talos = {
      source = "siderolabs/talos"
      version = "~> 0.7.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://192.168.1.21:8006/"
  insecure = true
}

module "talos" {
    source  = "bbtechsys/talos/proxmox"
    version = "0.1.5"
    talos_cluster_name = "test-cluster"
    talos_version = "1.9.5"
    control_nodes = {
        "test-control-0" = "pve1"
        "test-control-1" = "pve1"
        "test-control-2" = "pve1"
    }
    worker_nodes = {
        "test-worker-0" = "pve1"
        "test-worker-1" = "pve1"
        "test-worker-2" = "pve1"
    }
}

output "talos_config" {
    description = "Talos configuration file"
    value       = module.talos.talos_config
    sensitive   = true
}

output "kubeconfig" {
    description = "Kubeconfig file"
    value       = module.talos.kubeconfig
    sensitive   = true
}
```

## In-place upgrades

`talos_version` sets the version of the running cluster. Changing it does not
recreate the VMs: the module shells out to `talosctl upgrade` per node (workers
first, then control planes), which reboots each node into the new version with
disks and node identity intact.

This is off by default so that bumping the module version never touches a
running cluster on its own. Opt in with:

```terraform
talos_upgrade_enabled = true
```

Requirements and caveats:

- `talosctl` must be on the machine running terraform, and it must be able to
  reach the node IPs.
- With the flag off, changing `talos_version` only updates the machine config
  and the image new nodes install from -- running nodes stay where they are.
- `talos_image_version` pins the boot ISO separately; it defaults to
  `talos_version`.
